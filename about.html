<h3>Who's Sarah</h3>
<p>I am a tech enthusiast who enjoys how absolutely everything revolves around technology in today's world which is why I am majoring Information technology in Mount Kenya University. Someday, I hope to contribute to the creation of technological solutions that improve people's lives. I've had a passion in technology from a young age, and I remember asking my mom so many questions about how her phone worked and how the person she was talking to fit inside a phone. From feeding my curiosity, every answer to my questions was interesting. Now that I'm older, it's fun to know how things work, and it's even more fun to know you can do something like my mom's phone and make life easier.

<h3>Expertise</h3>
<p>I've worked with a range of organizations, including hotels, telecommunications firms, and healthcare providers, and have over three years of experience in sales, marketing, customer relations, content production, and corporate communications. Today, I am branching out in tech as an IT, but I still use my expertise in communications and customer relations with soft IT skills to easily do my everyday work. I owe my success to prioritizing and putting my passion into whatever I do. I never hesitate to learn new things and push myself to get better every day. As Simon Sinek once said, "No one knows everything. But we know a lot when we work together." I enjoy surrounding myself with experts and smart people from every area as there is always something new to learn.
